# [Project 01: Statistical Analysis for Campus Recruitment](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sungsujeong/James_Portfolio/tree/master/Project%2001/)
* Identified what factors influenced a candidate in getting hired by conducting statistical analysis:
  * __ANOVA__
  * __Linear regression__
  * __Logistic regression__
* Predicted the probability of whether a candidate will land a job by applying a multiple logistic regression model built
* Used SAS

* Identified the features that significantly affect the product sale success
* Conducted exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis
* Used Python

# [Project 03: Cluster Analysis for Mall Customer Segmentation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sungsujeong/James_Portfolio/blob/master/Project%2003/Project%2003_Mall%20Customer%20Segmentation_Cluster%20Analysis.ipynb)

* Took a step-by-step tour of conventional version of the __K-means clustering algorithm__
* Segmented customers into groups with similar purchase histories, which businees can then use to create targeted marketing campaigns
* Used Python

* Performed linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between variables to answer the questions below:
  * "what are the indicators that raise the probability of scoring a goal?"
  * "Does a team with the better defence tend to win a match?"
  * "What are the factors that could determine the victory of a match?
* Used Python

# [Project 05: S&P 500 Time Series Forecasting with Prophet](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sungsujeong/James_Portfolio/blob/master/Project%2005/Project%2005_S%26P%20500%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20with%20Prophet.ipynb)

* Forecast stock prices using Prophet which is Facebook's library for time series forcasting
* Compared Netflix stock prices that are predicted by Prophet and the actual stock prices
